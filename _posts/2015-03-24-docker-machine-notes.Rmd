Docker recently released `docker-machine` to make managing multiple remote machines locally easier.
Docker distributes binaries of `docker-machine` for most major architectures ready-to-go, potentially making it easier to get started on Windows and Mac as well. 

Set credentials in environmental variables so we don't have to pass them
on the command line each time:

```bash
DIGITALOCEAN_ACCESS_TOKEN = XXX
```

and create the docker-machine: 

```
docker-machine create --driver digitalocean --digitalocean-size "1gb" server-name
```

where `server-name` is any name you want to give your server and `DO_PAT` is your access token (say, saved as an environmental variable). Here we launch a 1GB instance, the default is 512MB on digitalocean.  Many other providers work just as well (including virtualbox). You need to set your terminal to use the active `docker-machine` for all `docker` commands, instead of the local `docker` installation:

```bash
eval "$(docker-machine env server-name)"
```

sets three environmental variables that point your `docker` commands to the new remote machine, `server-name`.  Wow.  We can now launch any service of interest:

```bash
docker run -d -p 8787:8787 -e PASSWORD=something rocker/hadleyverse
```

and it will run on the server.  Get the IP address of the active machine with `docker-machine ip`, e.g. open the server in the browser (from a Ubuntu-based client)

```bash
xdg-open http://`docker-machine ip`:8787
```


You can see a list of active machines with `docker-machine ls` and switch between machines with `docker-machine env` as shown above.  Remove a machine as you would a container, e.g. `docker-machine rm -f server-name`, which also shuts down the remote server so you will not be charged.


This is a bit more overhead than launching a container on an existing local or remote server instance, but not much; and easily scripted. Of course the latency is higher too: the start-up time for the DO instance takes two minutes, and pulling a sizable image onto DO machine takes another two minutes or so.
