Interesting editorial in Nature Biotech yesterday; [doi:10.1038/nbt.3202](http://doi.org/10.1038/nbt.3202) on increasing reproducibility requirements in light increasing complexity of computational analysis and big data.

- computational reproducibility is hard.  

- every bit helps, but reviewers can only accomplish so much.  cultural expectations in many fields are that an expert can conduct a review in a few hours.  still, this raises the bar and helps post-publication review. 

- black box reproducibility is helpful but limited

- lots of research uses computational tools but isn't scripted.
