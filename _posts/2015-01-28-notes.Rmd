`MDPToolbox` testing
------------------

- Debugging [RPub record](http://rpubs.com/cboettig/55260)
- Fails even if we restrict R to be finite (`h < 1`)
- Different error if we try the optimal harvest

### Continuous Integration ###

Finally a way to run generic docker images on free CI: [circle-ci](https://circleci.com/docs/docker)

Adding private keys to Travis requires too much of a dance (encrypting credentials into `.travis.yml`; on Circle-CI, like Drone, these can just be configured through the Circle-CI web interface.  Travis has no way to restart a stochastically failed build without another commit, doesn't display the logs in  a convenient summary, and doesn't support deploying as first-class configuration step (though easy enough to hack it of course)




Sample configuration:

```yaml
machine:
  services:
    - docker

dependencies:
  override:
    - docker info
    - docker build -t circleci/elasticsearch .

test:
  override:
    - docker run -d -p 9200:9200 circleci/elasticsearch; sleep 10
    - curl --retry 10 --retry-delay 5 -v http://localhost:9200

deployment:
  hub:
    branch: master
    commands:
      - docker login -e $DOCKER_EMAIL -u $DOCKER_USER -p $DOCKER_PASS
      - docker push circleci/elasticsearch
```
